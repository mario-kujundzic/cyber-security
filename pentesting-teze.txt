> CSP (Cross Site Policy): Wildcard directive
	> The following directives either allow wildcard sources (or ancestors), are not defined, or are overly broadly defined: frame-ancestors, form-action
	
	> The frame-ancestors directive allows you to specify which parent URLs can frame the current resource. Using the frame-ancestors CSP directive we can block or allow a page from being placed within a frame or iframe.
	
	> An iFrame is not a problem on its own, despite the bad reputation. It's the ease with which hackers can inject malicious code into frames or create frames and insert them into web content that threatens site security.
	
	> Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is properly configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header - The Content-Security-Policy header allows you to restrict how resources such as JavaScript, CSS, or pretty much anything that the browser loads. > Define valid sources of JavaScript, images etc.


> X-Frame-Options not set 
	> povezano sa frame, iframe, embed

> Incomplete or no cache control and Pragma Http header set
	
	> The cache-control and pragma HTTP header have not been set properly or are missing allowing the browser and proxies to cache content
	
	> Whenever possible ensure the cache-control HTTP header is set with no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate; and that the pragma HTTP header is set with no-cache.

> Server leaks information via "X powered by"
	
	> The web/application server is leaking information via one or more "X-Powered-By" HTTP response headers. Access to such information may facilitate attackers identifying other frameworks/components your web application is reliant upon and the vulnerabilities such components may be subject to.

> X content type option missing
	> The missing "X-Content-Type-Options" header enables a browser to perform MIME type sniffing when the Content-Type header is not set or its value seems inappropriate.
